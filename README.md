## Assignment 2: The Black Death Project
------------------------------------
This project focuses upon the Great Plague of London in 1665. 

The programme investigates raster maps of rat populations and the average population denisty per 16 different parishes, to calculate the average weekly death rate from the epidemic. It then aims to use parameter sliders of the two factors to identify different outcomes and how they could have affected the death rate.

The programme runs in a Jupyter notebook and should work comfortably upon Windows.
